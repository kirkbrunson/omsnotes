## 9 - Logic and Planning
- Logic + Planning is a "core" of AI: allows reproducible reasoning and conclusions
	- Key Q: how to use logic tools to better model the world?
- Logic Background
	- Propositional logic: (OR, AND, =>, !, <=>, etc.)
		- Truth tables organize all possible outcomes
		- Valid -- true in all cases
		- Satisfiable -- true in some but not all cases
		- Propositional logic cons:
			- Only encodes T/F, difficult to encode uncertainty
			- No objects
			- No shortcuts -- need to go through all cases
	- First-Order (FO) logic: solves objects/shortcuts problems of propositional logic
		- Comparison of types of logic representation
		- FO logic uses Constants (values, no contraints), Functions (mappings of values), Relations (descriptors).
		- Syntax: like programming language
			- Terms: values, variables, functions
			- Sentences: T/F expressions using terms
			- Logic Operators: e.g. AND, OR, !, =>, <=>, ()
			- Quantifiers: For all, There exists, etc.
		- "First-Order" since relations describe objects (values/variables). In higher-order, relations can describe relations
	- Types of Logic Representations
		- Atomic Representation: states grouped together into atomic units (e.g. in search), values with variables
		- Factored Representation: states split into facts (e.g. propositional logic)
		- Structured Representation: Atomic + schema of relations (e.g. modern database schemas)
- Interleaving Planning and Execution
	- Only execution without planning analogy: blindfolded person told to follow directions. Has ability to do steps, but without feedback from environment difficult to actually execute plan
		- Especially important for environments that are: Stochastic (randomness), Multiagent, Parital Observability (full info not always available)
		- Additional complications if knowledge is: Unknown, Hierarchical
	- Partially observable state spaces occur due to limited sensors/information. Can model partially observable states by enumerating all possible state spaces and steps.
	- Stochastic state transitions occur due to natural error (e.g. wheels slipping) and can be modeled using proability.
	- Infinite Sequences: represent using tree structures, or while loops, or recursive function calls
		- Unbounded solution if every leaf leads to goal (i.e. infinite # of solutions)
		- Bounded solution if no loops (i.e. fixed sequences)
- Classical Planning
	- Given Start, Goal, State Space, World State, and Belief States, define pre-conditions necessary for an action to take place and define the effect of the action
- Regression Search: start at goal state and work backwards
	- Can be useful if there are few incoming edges to goal state (e.g. if you know what book to buy, only 1 path to buy a book. However starting from the goal of buying a book and searching, there are an infinite # of books to buy)
- Plan-Space Search: look through possible plans by slowly-expanding through possibile scenarios
	- Popular in 80's, however current approaches use more popular forward searches since easier to come-up with better heuristics (recall: generate heuristics by relaxing constraints on objective function)
- Situation Calculus: syntax using FO Logic for planning. Combines states with logic operators and outcomes (successor0-state axioms)
