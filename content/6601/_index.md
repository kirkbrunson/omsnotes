- Foundation: You should build a strong foundation in classic AI techniques like game playing, search, constraint satisfaction, logic and planning, machine learning, graphical models, etc.
- Skills: You should be able to propose, evaluate, and implement solutions to problems requiring AI techniques.
- Integration: You should be aware of where AI intersects with other disciplines, primarily machine learning and perception.
- Assessment: You should have experienced different flavors of problems and solutions, and have developed a taste for some; you should also have confidence in how and where AI can be applied in problems relevant to society.
