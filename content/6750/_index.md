## About:

This course is an introductory course on human-computer interaction. It does not presuppose any earlier knowledge of human-computer interaction, computer science, or psychology. The class covers three broad categories of topics within human-computer interaction: 1) the principles and characteristics of the interaction between humans and computers; 2) the techniques for designing and evaluating user-centered systems; and 3) current areas of cutting-edge research and development in human-computer interaction.

Course deliverables are a series of projects focusing on design principles and method as well as two exams. 

This class does count towards the foundational degree requirement.
